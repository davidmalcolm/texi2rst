How To Get Help with GCC
------------------------

If you need help installing, using or changing GCC, there are two
ways to find it:

* Send a message to a suitable network mailing list.  First try
  gcc-helpgcc.gnu.org (for help installing or using GCC), and if
  that brings no response, try gccgcc.gnu.org.  For help
  changing GCC, ask gccgcc.gnu.org.  If you think you have found
  a bug in GCC, please report it following the instructions at
  Bug Reporting.

  * Look in the service directory for someone who might help you for a fee.
  The service directory is found at
  http://www.fsf.org/resources/service.

For further information, see
