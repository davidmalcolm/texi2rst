# About

The project aims converting [texinfo](https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/) files
into reStructuredText format (used by [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/)).

## GCC usage

We upload built HTML, PDF and manual pages for the GCC project (devel/sphinx branch)
to https://splichal.eu/scripts/sphinx.

Generated RST files are automatically pushed to the following repository:
https://github.com/marxin/texi2rst-generated.
