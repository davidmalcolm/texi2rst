# About

The project aims to convert [texinfo](https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/) files
into reStructuredText (the format used by [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/)).

## GCC usage

We upload built HTML, PDF and manual pages for the GCC project (devel/sphinx branch)
to https://splichal.eu/scripts/sphinx.

Generated RST files are automatically pushed to the [texi2rst-generated](https://github.com/marxin/texi2rst-generated) repository.
